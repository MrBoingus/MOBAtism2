Currently working on:
	Added Ranged Attack to Tower

league attack speed converter: 1/attack speed = timer value

How to scale UI so it is clear at all distances?
A: Presumably, we will scale it with the Camera Zoom level

Added an explanation of the minion wave handler to the
"wave handler" node.

BUFFS AND DEBUFFS WILL NEED HEAVY REVISITING LATER.
- perhaps we should make status effects that can possibly
	apply crowd control effects. 2 resources
- add node child and assign it debuff script?
- add all debuffs to a global list, have something check if any are true,
	and do something if they are?

*moved player collision box cause it was the ground for some reason.
will see if this causes problems.
