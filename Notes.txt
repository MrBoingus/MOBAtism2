Currently working on:
	Selection Radius?

*moved player collision box cause it was the ground for some reason.
will see if this causes problems.

NOTE: Characters in League with an identical search radius and
attack range will sometimes target enemies slightly outside of their
attack radius because every character has a selection hitbox of sorts
that can make them larger than their model appears.
